# Shopping Website

This is just a project I created on my own and refering papers because I took a hiatus for two years to prepare for a competitive exam, so just to be back, I started with a language I learned before, php, so let me know if I can make this project any decent with your suggestions. 

# Information for checking the project:
1) Download or clone the file. 
2) execute a Localhost on your machine. I used Xampp for this project. 
3) Load the database into the SQL database and execute on the localhost. 



# To explore: 
1) Category-wise sorting.
2) There are two logins: one for admin with the username admin and password 123, and one for customers with the username customer and password 123.
3) The admin panel allows you to create, update, and delete goods, categories, carousel slides, and add an admin.

I could have also added many things like pagination, checking out, and so on, but I thought this much was enough for a practice and I wanted to learn the mern stack, so I did this much and left it. I know it's bad to leave projects, but I wanted to do other things. This was just a confidence building or revising, maybe.


#Stack used : i worked only with php, html, css and js the frontend is not mine its bootstrap template
